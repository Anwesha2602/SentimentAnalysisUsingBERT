            "[\"Yash Chopra's last cinematic outing left me feeling somewhat conflicted, but I would still recommend it as a watch for any fan of Yashji. First I would like to elucidate the moving and effective parts of the film before I go on to the major critique. Firstly, the performances from all of the actors were at least at par with their previous work, and I thought Shah Rukh, in his role as a Major in the Indian army was one of the best of his career. In addition, the cinematography and the songs in the movie were both enchanting and involving. The story is very compelling and (though a touch filmy) gets the viewer involved in the struggle between the characters very well, a feature that is common to most of Yashji's work in any case. On to the negative aspects. While the story is engaging, the character development is somewhat confusing. We get to see the change in Shahrukh over time from a carefree worker in London to a cold and calculating soldier carefully orchestrated over time, and yet Katrina's character is portrayed in a very nebulous light. She takes her relationship with God very seriously in some areas, but in others it seems to be at the back of her mind if it is there at all. Normally I would attribute this to Kaif's lack of depth in acting ability, but in this case she cannot be entirely to blame as she was at least adequate in the role she was given. The second major problem is that the antagonist, God, is never portrayed (if He could be at all) in a very distinctive light. It would be giving away plot points to say exactly why, but suffice it to say that Chopra did not seem to have the heart to actually portray a fight against God, and so the effort of making him the only true antagonist seems to be halfhearted. Finally, in the final third of the movie, a somewhat shady tactic is used in order to propel the story forward. While I have seen worse devices used in Bollywood films, it did seem like a somewhat cheap ploy to utilize in order to move forward. This does seem to somewhat distance the audience from the actual plight of the characters and further seems to muddy Katrina Kaif's role in the film. Overall, I would not call this a terrible movie by any stretch and certainly a beautiful film to watch, but if there is any lesson to take away from this film (other than for Shahrukh Khan not to go on the streets in London) is to keep it simple and that emotion can only go as far as reality allows it.\", \"Directed by the late Yash Chopra, the film doesn't cease to impress the romantic movie lovers and of course SRK fans. People go in with some expectations of a 'Yash Chopra' type of romance and are not disappointed at all. It begins with a fearless army officer Samar moving all along Kashmir diffusing bombs without tinge of fear in his mind. The story flies in flashback after the audience is well settled for the movie. Shah Rukh Khan handles the role of a strict army officer and jolly youngster so well that it seems hard to believe that both roles are played by the same man. Anushka sharma is bubbly and ' happy-go-lucky girl' who lives life to the fullest breathing every moment of her life happily. Katrina Kaif on other hand is exactly opposite to Anushka. She is a God-lover, believes in goodness,reserved, n filled totally with love. Yashji never lost hold of his directorial touch in the movie. The songs do deserve a thumbs up. Especially the romantic Saans and foot-tapping Ishq shava. Challa makes u groove a bit on your seat. Heer likely to trigger some emotion So for all the romance lovers, JTHJ is a perfect and 'go for it' film.\", 'Jab Tak Hai Jaan - In a time dominated by South Indian remakes and illogical stunts comes a movie that is so refreshingly different from those mindless sagas. A movie that connects to that Old World charm and beauty of a special feeling called Love. A movie that will make you feel good about life and gives you hope about love. Though an Love Story on the surface, the movie has its own layers of emotional undercurrent running from its inception till the last frame. And The Great Yash Chopra is not called a LEGEND just like that, he justified his legendary status yet again with a MASTERPIECE. And there is no match for SRK when it comes to intense roles. He excelled in a role tailor made for him only. When MR Bachhan calls his\\' act as \"THE BEST\" after Swades, who are we to comment on that. Still, I believe this movie will not appeal to all, as not everyone is born with a good taste and we can\\'t help it.', \"Amazong plot, great direction and brilliant acting is what that sum up to a good movie. JTHJ had all three of them.Being one of the most anticipated Bollywood movie of the year(SRK's only movie), audiences had high hopes. I doubt any of them would have been disappointed. From the very beginning to the end, it was terrific. Three best thing about this movie were its plot, A. R. Rahman's music and SRK. His acting was brilliant, but that's hardly a surprise. Katrina, after a long time since Namastey London, has given a convincing role. Her chemistry with SRK was great. But even with her relatively small role, I think Anushka Sharma came on top with her acting and unmatched facial expressions.Movie isn't predictable...at all. You'll keep guessing how its going to end and it will surprise you. Its unpredictability is another factor you won't find anybody yawning.Summ- One of the best romantic movie to ever been made. Do NOT miss it. I would give it 11 on10, but that will be a wee bit difficult. Mr. Yash Chopra's last movie is probably his best. RIP Sir!\", \"The film starts off with Yash Chopra's portrait and his own special Jab Tak Hai Jaan poem. And from that moment, you're transported to his magical world to witness his take on love. You see the world from his perspective, and accept anything (whether good or bad) with the most idiotic smile on your face. If you snap out or zone out of that phase, then you probably won't enjoy JTHJ. Otherwise, you're in for the best romantic saga of 2012, where true love is beyond anything, where love defies everything. Yes, even God's will.The premise of Jab Tak Hai Jaan is simple - almost too common. The framework is similar to Yash Chopra's Veer Zaara - start from present, flashback, 2 lovers, separation for a long time.... then the same questions. Why are they not together? Will they end up together?It worked for me in Veer Zaara. And it did here as well. If I were to compare, I'd say that Veer Zaara's story had more ''meat'' - and the reason was more compelling and made a bigger impact there. Jab Tak Hai Jaan's twist will meet with a mixed reaction - you'll either approve of it or think it's highly stupid. It will all come down to how you warm up to Meera's character, and agree or disagree with her ideologies. This is another crucial point which determines whether Jab Tak Hai Jaan will work or not for you. And if it doesn't at the interval, then do walk out because you'd certainly not enjoy the second half or the climax.Jab Tak Hai Jaan works primarily because Yash Chopra manages to make you believe in his vision. As a director, he has that ability to present his storyline in the most innocent, simplistic, convincing way.The film comes with a fair share of blemishes. The pace & length being the major culprits. In that respect, the editing and screenplay should have been tighter. The writing by Aditya Chopra could have been more imaginativeThe love and passion were present, and how. No one does it better than Yash Chopra. And no one portrays it better than Shah Rukh Khan. Lethal combo. I always use this vague term - but Jab Tak Hai Jaan has so much soul and has its heart in the right place. Picturisation and cinematography deserve full marks. Dialogues were simple for most part - and I liked that. There were a few really deep ones which I absolutely loved.A.R.Rahman's music is apt for the film. It does lack the ''epic'' vibe throughout the film, but then comes the title track at the end, and you're sold. Shah Rukh Khan, as Samar, was flawless. Every single time. You think he's done it all. You think there won't be any novelty in his approach. And yet he comes and blows you away. The intensity he brings in, and the powerful control of emotions he displays is just brilliant. His outburst scene at the church, is more than enough for me, to declare this as my favourite male performance of the year. Katrina Kaif went all out for this role, and it's obvious. Her dancing and attitude in Ishq Dance was out of this world!! I take my hat off to you, Kat. And her pole dancing in the tube, major turn on. This was no doubt her best look yet. Acting wise, Katrina does well. It's a sincere performance with many ups and one down. She messes up her breakdown scene before interval -but that aside, she was natural to the core, and this is something she should be proud of. Anushka Sharma as Akira brings the freshness required to get Samar out of his shell. The chick's energy is infectious - and it's hard not to fall for her character. Her crying scene is one of the most natural ones I've seen so far. Rishi Kapoor & Neetu Singh have a special appearance, but a crucial one. In fact, Pooja (Neetu)'s scene with Meera takes the story forward and those 8 minutes between the four stars were one of the plusses of the film. Rishi is his jolly, flirtatious self, while Neetu has more to play with, and leaves a good impact. Watching Anupam Kher was a delight. In short, I liked it. While not perfect as a whole, there's nothing to hate as such from Jab Tak Hai Jaan. It's a saga. An almost dreamy one. If you're charmed enough by the premise and the characters, then you'll have a good time.This will remain the most special film of 2012 - whether you love it, like it or hate it. Go, celebrate Yash Chopra.\", \"A sweet but twisted romantic movie by Yash ji which redefines love stories. A movie that should not be compared to Veer Zaara which had a different aspect.Jab Tak Hai Jaan is unique in it's own way,it has all the moments in it.A story about a man whose life has played a freaking game with him for getting his ladylove. Plus Points:Great performances of three leading actors-Shah Rukh,Katrina & Anushka. Movie direction by Yash ji and Music direction by A R Rahman saab. Choreography by Vaibhabi Merchant and cinematography by Anil Mehta. Story by Aditya Chopra. Minus Points: A little bit of excess length (needs patience).\", \"We see Major Samar Anand (Shah Rukh Khan) being the shining star of the Indian Army's bomb disposal unit, clocking almost close to a hundred IED diffusion and doing so in daredevil fashion. Some call him the man without fear, while others coin the term the man who cannot die, because his job is high risk, but he doesn't take the necessary precautions. The routine involves going off for a little quiet time for himself after having stared death in the face, but this time round got rudely interrupted by the vivacious Akira Rai (Anushka Sharma), who is adamant to get a stint with Discovery Channel, and chanced upon Samar's diary of sorts which got left behind.And this natural flashback provided a look into the Major's past before his army career, being a multiple job holder in London in order to make ends meet, from shoveling of snow to the waiting on tables, to being a fishmonger, and busking in the streets. Fate allows him to meet poor little rich girl Meera (Katrina Kaif), and before you know it, their constant interaction to exchange tips in the learning of languages form the basis of their relationship, even though Meera is engaged to a rich scion. I suppose no girl can resist the charms of a man who can serenade at multiple London landmarks, and dance the way SRK does.But here's the catch which I thought was an extremely bold move. Religion comes into play, and this takes on proportions and depth of discussions about how some put religion as priority, having empowerment over their lives, that it could sometimes lead to paralysis of sorts. To save Samar's life, Meera makes a pact with her spiritual father, and I suppose only a bet as big as exchanging one's happiness with the life of another, can bring that prayerful wish to fruition. But this causes bitterness in Samar because how can one do battle with Jesus? It's almost impossible, but if this rivalry of one's heart, toward man and toward god, isn't colossus, then I don't know what is.I suppose what Yash Chopra's story was trying to say, is that without love, or keeping the faith, one's life can get really inward and withdrawn, losing that fun element with all things going really serious, and at times, reckless. Samar goes back to India and fulfills his family lineage of military men, but chooses the riskiest of professions, if only to tempt the higher being at taking his life away, and in such fashion to put a dent in his ex lover's faith. Akira enters the picture, and finds this old fashion love of the previous decade a lot more meaningful than the present throwaway ones that centers around physical love. The second half after the intermission sees the relentless pursuit Akira has for Samar, only for her constant advances to be continuously rejected, because in essence, Samar's heart was locked in on another, and left for dead.As if that wasn't enough - with how Samar has turned into a Meera even without his knowledge, in shutting people out - Yash Chopra has more up his sleeves when he has to put everyone together, forming tremendous tension especially when throwing in one of the oldest plot elements in the book for a romance, albeit too with one too many hospital stays. It's decision time, and you'll find yourself taking sides as to who Samar should eventually end up with, after having emotionally invested an hour with each heroine. Characterization here is top notch in making everyone of them rich and real, that you'll probably see shades of yourself, or people you may know, in one or more of the leading protagonists.Shah Rukh Khan once again shows why he's one of the leading men in Bollywood, with his fine all round performance in being a younger man who is full of zeal, hope and life, with the world ahead of him given his hard work, and yet balancing that out with a more sullen, serious look as the hardened military man with a death wish, nursing a broken heart and resigned to the impossibility of challenging god. Between the two leading ladies, it is difficult to pick who actually had an edge over the other, but if it's a personal choice, I'd give my vote to Anushka Sharma if only for her assured portrayal of a bubbly personality who knows what she wants and is a go getter, being in for a challenge when encountered with emotions she has yet to handle, compared to the more indecisive character that Katrina perfectly portrayed, in what would be a classic Yash Chopra model of the unattainable femme fatale responsible for the total breaking of hearts.Cinematography is great, as you would come to expect from a Yash Raj production, with lush costumes, glossy production and art design, sets and locales being nothing but the best to put you in the mood for love, and love lost or broken. Music by none other than A.R. Rahman also lifts the film into epic greatness, befitting a contemporary love story of our time. If anything, Yash Chopra's parting gift through his films, and this one in particular, is a reminder to keep the faith, that love will come in good time, and to remember to live life, not be afraid of it. A definite must watch backed by all the right reasons.\", 'Jab Tak Hai Jaan (Review) - The movie has finally hit the screens with a lot of expectations mainly because it is the swansong of late veteran director Yash Chopra and also because it is a Shah Rukh Khan starrer. This movie was initially touted as \"A Yash Chopra romance\" as it is a genre in which the director has excelled in making movies from about half a decade. The movie begins in the present day when Samar Anand (Shah Rukh Khan), employed with Indian Army, dressed in military outfit makes an entry on an RE 500 and is trying to diffuse a bomb which he specialises in. Then enters a happy go lucky Iraa Rai (Anushka Sharma), a prospective documentary film-maker. By sequence of events we are soon taken 10 years back in time in London where Samar is employed to clear snow off the roads after a snowstorm which is just one among the many jobs he does to earn a living. On one such day, Samar comes across the other protagonist Meera (Katrina Kaif) who is running into a church to make a confession. Samar instantly falls for Meera, the daughter of a very well known industrialist played by Anupam Kher. No sooner, events take turn and Meera who approaches Samar to learn punjabi, falls for him. After a long wait, the interval which eluded you for a while actually happens. In the second half, Iraa wants to make a documentary on Samar Anand for Discovery Channel. So she goes around with him on all his endeavours and makes a documentary titled \"The man who cannot die\" inspired by all the successful bomb diffusing endeavours of Samar. Then Samar meets with an accident and ends up losing memory and can remember nothing since 2002. Finally what happens to the protagonists, Who lands up with whom in the climax is to be watched on the big screen. Yash Chopra who is known for capturing scenic locations and portraying romance like none other, has excelled in that front this time as well which is evident as the crowd cheers every single frame that looks exquisite. Cinematography is one of the USP\\'s of the movie as landscapes in Kashmir, the London bridge have been shot so well to the liking of the audience. A.R. Rahman makes his mark as well as the music of the film stands out in a couple of songs like Challa, Saans and Ishq Shava. Watching Challa and Saans on the big screen is literally a treat to one\\'s eyes. The music for the street dancing sequence and the choreography for the same is also brilliantly done. Watching this movie would probably take you back in time to those days when cinema meant storytelling. Glad to see that the Hindi film industry is going back to storytelling ways and that is definitely one of the main things that makes you sit back and watch even though about 15-20 mins in the second half might seem to be a bit dragging. The length of the movie could have been trimmed though. The performances by the actors are commendable. The montages of the making of \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" is shown at the end of the movie as a tribute to the director. The last frame in which Yash Chopra says \"ACTION\" and the crowd in the theatre clap, was the best tribute probably depicting that the man will always live on with his work. Watch this movie for it is definitely worth a watch. My verdict - 7/10.', 'It is a good sweet love story. I personally adore Late Yash sir films. Till interval I was very scared because movie is very slow till interval, almost at the level of boredom. Nothing happens. Just before 15 minutes it takes good pace and suddenly you start enjoying it. Movie runs on a good pace till half an hour before climax. Again it slows down badly before climax. I was unable to understand that if one forgets something which is not very important to survive or any strong reason then why all are very desperate to make him remember. Thank God , climax is good. A very good story but screenplay by Aditya Chopda and Devika Bhagat is not up to mark. It drags so many times. Dialogues by Aditya Chopda , are very good, especially after interval. Performance wise Anushka Sharma is show stopper. Shahrukh Khan is very good in intense emotional scenes as usual. Katrina Kaif is also good. She is very balanced actually. Music by A.R. Rehman is good. One song is very good \"SAANS MEIN TERI SAANS MILE\". It\\'s lyrics is typical of Gulzar Saab one but rest one lacks his mastery. Tune wise this one and another song \"HEER\" is good. After all one time must watch.', 'Hello.. I watched Jab Tak Hai Jaan.. And I am not at all disappointed after watching this movie.. Brilliant Movie..Acting was good of all the stars.. But SRK was perfect like as usual..Unique Love story.. Watch this movie you will fall in love once Again..Yashji thanks for this movie..The chemistry between SRK and Katrina was really good.Twists were good in d movie..Music was excellent.. Direction was good.Perfect Movie to watch with family..Guys Must watch...', \"A perfect love story from the duo - Yash Chopra and Shahrukh again after a long time (I hope Veer-Zaara was the last). This movie filled with Love, Romance and enjoyment.Katrina's fans: you must see this :) Storyline: Though there is nothing in this story which you can't imagine while watching it, but little way out of a normal one.Direction: Direction was amazing, hats off!Acting: Shahrukh, Katrina and Anushka acted very well in this movie.A full family entertainment movie, go and watch this on this festive occasion! I would rate 8/10 Dear readers Wish you a very Happy Diwali to you and your family!\", \"The movie had the best music. A very good presentation of love and pain what i saw in eyes of Sharukh and katrina. the first half was so awesome when sharukh saw katrina and narrates her pari ...and was truly madly in love with her. katrina did an amazing job. She looked very natural and it was great to see the way she learned punjabi song and then they had a cool dance and after a kiss she started loving sharukh. they both were amazing together on the screen. The movie was sweet till the interval and other half was a bit pain. and emotional but that i believe was the good balance kept. and the best thing about what i liked in movie was the love which was still there for srk and kat for each other after 10 years! we don't usually get to see such nice movies these days! it was the best .. cant wait to get a copy of this for my personal collection\", \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan. It's not good because it's last indulgent attempt of Yash Chopra. It is good because Yash Chopra had the ability to adapt his love stories to changing times. His hero has still the old soul of undying love but one of his heroine is straight from the generation from 21st century. Every love story has a villain who does not like lovers to be close to each other, here he is God himself. The story has three acts, first riding on confident performance of Shahrukh Khan, second act riding on soulful energy of Anushka Sharma but third act is where writer and directors find themselves in confused state and let the story fill with few silly twists. Movie works because it has soul, neat characterization, uncluttered screenplay and nice background score but it is let down by average work by A.R.Rahman and Gulzar in songs by their standards and the average performance by Katrina Kaif which could have been a killer performance if played by some better talent. Nevertheless, it is a nice love story to enjoy once for sure.\"]\n"

The movie was sweet till the interval and other half was a bit pain. and emotional but that i believe was the good balance kept. and the best thing about what i liked in movie was the love which was still there for srk and kat for each other after 10 years! we don't usually get to see such nice movies these days! it was the best .. cant wait to get a copy of this for my personal collection\",\n          \"Hello..

Watch this movie you will fall in love once Again..Yashji thanks for this movie..The chemistry between SRK and Katrina was really good.Twists were good in d movie..Music was excellent.. Direction was good.Perfect Movie to watch with family..Guys Must watch...\",\n          \"Yash Chopra's last cinematic outing left me feeling somewhat conflicted, but I would still recommend it as a watch for any fan of Yashji. First I would like to elucidate the moving and effective parts of the film before I go on to the major critique. Firstly, the performances from all of the actors were at least at par with their previous work, and I thought Shah Rukh, in his role as a Major in the Indian army was one of the best of his career. In addition, the cinematography and the songs in the movie were both enchanting and involving. The story is very compelling and (though a touch filmy) gets the viewer involved in the struggle between the characters very well, a feature that is common to most of Yashji's work in any case. On to the negative aspects. While the story is engaging, the character development is somewhat confusing. We get to see the change in Shahrukh over time from a carefree worker in London to a cold and calculating soldier carefully orchestrated over time, and yet Katrina's character is portrayed in a very nebulous light. She takes her relationship with God very seriously in some areas, but in others it seems to be at the back of her mind if it is there at all. Normally I would attribute this to Kaif's lack of depth in acting ability, but in this case she cannot be entirely to blame as she was at least adequate in the role she was given. The second major problem is that the antagonist, God, is never portrayed (if He could be at all) in a very distinctive light. It would be giving away plot points to say exactly why, but suffice it to say that Chopra did not seem to have the heart to actually portray a fight against God, and so the effort of making him the only true antagonist seems to be halfhearted. Finally, in the final third of the movie, a somewhat shady tactic is used in order to propel the story forward. While I have seen worse devices used in Bollywood films, it did seem like a somewhat cheap ploy to utilize in order to move forward. This does seem to somewhat distance the audience from the actual plight of the characters and further seems to muddy Katrina Kaif's role in the film. Overall, I would not call this a terrible movie by any stretch and certainly a beautiful film to watch, but if there is any lesson to take away from this film (other than for Shahrukh Khan not to go on the streets in London) is to keep it simple and that emotion can only go as far as reality allows it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The movie was sweet till the interval and other half was a bit pain. and emotional but that i believe was the good balance kept. and the best thing about what i liked in movie was the love which was still there for srk and kat for each other after 10 years! we don't usually get to see such nice movies these days! it was the best .. cant wait to get a copy of this for my personal collection\",\n          \"Hello..

Direction was good.Perfect Movie to watch with family..Guys Must watch...\",\n          \"Yash Chopra's last cinematic outing left me feeling somewhat conflicted, but I would still recommend it as a watch for any fan of Yashji. First I would like to elucidate the moving and effective parts of the film before I go on to the major critique. Firstly, the performances from all of the actors were at least at par with their previous work, and I thought Shah Rukh, in his role as a Major in the Indian army was one of the best of his career. In addition, the cinematography and the songs in the movie were both enchanting and involving. The story is very compelling and (though a touch filmy) gets the viewer involved in the struggle between the characters very well, a feature that is common to most of Yashji's work in any case. On to the negative aspects. While the story is engaging, the character development is somewhat confusing. We get to see the change in Shahrukh over time from a carefree worker in London to a cold and calculating soldier carefully orchestrated over time, and yet Katrina's character is portrayed in a very nebulous light. She takes her relationship with God very seriously in some areas, but in others it seems to be at the back of her mind if it is there at all. Normally I would attribute this to Kaif's lack of depth in acting ability, but in this case she cannot be entirely to blame as she was at least adequate in the role she was given. The second major problem is that the antagonist, God, is never portrayed (if He could be at all) in a very distinctive light. It would be giving away plot points to say exactly why, but suffice it to say that Chopra did not seem to have the heart to actually portray a fight against God, and so the effort of making him the only true antagonist seems to be halfhearted. Finally, in the final third of the movie, a somewhat shady tactic is used in order to propel the story forward. While I have seen worse devices used in Bollywood films, it did seem like a somewhat cheap ploy to utilize in order to move forward. This does seem to somewhat distance the audience from the actual plight of the characters and further seems to muddy Katrina Kaif's role in the film. Overall, I would not call this a terrible movie by any stretch and certainly a beautiful film to watch, but if there is any lesson to take away from this film (other than for Shahrukh Khan not to go on the streets in London) is to keep it simple and that emotion can only go as far as reality allows it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"star\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 3,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          4,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
